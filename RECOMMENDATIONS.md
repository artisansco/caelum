# Caelum Project Recommendations & TODO List

This document contains all identified issues and improvement recommendations for the Caelum school management system, organized by criticality and category.

## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL PRIORITY (Fix Immediately)

### Security Vulnerabilities

- [ ] **FIX JWT VERIFICATION** - `src/lib/auth.ts:23-26` manually parses JWT without signature verification! Anyone can forge tokens. Use `jwt.verify()` with secret validation
- [ ] **Add password complexity requirements** - No password policies enforced (min 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, special char)
- [ ] **Add rate limiting on authentication** - No protection against brute force attacks on login endpoints
- [ ] **Fix JWT expiration checking** - Token decoded but expiration never verified
- [ ] **Add session invalidation mechanism** - No way to invalidate tokens on logout or password change
- [ ] **Implement refresh token system** - Current tokens expire after 1 day with no refresh mechanism

### Input Validation & Sanitization

- [ ] **Sanitize Tiptap rich text content** - XSS vulnerability in announcements and assignments (add DOMPurify)
- [ ] **Add file upload validation** - No size limits, type checking, or malicious file detection
- [ ] **Implement secure temp directories** - File uploads don't use secure temporary storage
- [ ] **Standardize validation libraries** - Mixed use of Valibot and Zod across codebase (standardize on Valibot)
- [ ] **Add comprehensive file type whitelist** - Only allow safe file types for uploads

### Core Missing Features (README Requirements)

- [ ] **Student Portal & Result Viewing** - Students cannot search/view results by admission number (core README requirement)
- [ ] **Student Authentication System** - No login/auth for students, only staff
- [ ] **PDF Export Functionality** - Cannot generate PDF reports for results (README requires this)
- [ ] **Excel Export Functionality** - Cannot export results to Excel format (README requires this)

### Code Issues

- [ ] **Expose grade edit functionality** - `update_grade()` exists in database layer but not in remote functions (grades.remote.ts)
- [ ] **Fix Dialog component state binding** - Dialog component needs optional `bind:open` prop for proper state management
- [ ] **Fix permission system enforcement** - Permissions stored but NEVER checked in UI or remote functions
